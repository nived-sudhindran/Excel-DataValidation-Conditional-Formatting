This Excel file contains Name, Mobile# , DOB, Subject and Marks in % for each students.

So I have created a Data Validation for Mobile No.- Will accept only 10 Digit Numbers between 7000000000 & 9999999999 , which is basically accepting only Whole Numbers

Another Data Validation for DOB - to accept only Date Values between the years 1990 and 2020. Any Value outside the range will be rejected this prompt message for rejection.

Another Data Validation for List Type - will allow to select values from a DropDown List for Column SUBJECT

CONDOTIONAL FORMATTING
1. To identify if duplication occurs in Mobile No. Column, as it should be unique. No multiple students will have same mobile numbers.
2. In Column MARKS IN %, Highlight Condition has been given for values less than 50% in RED FONT COLOR; for values from 50% and above will have GREEN FONT COLOR
3. Also has included DATA BARS to quickly identify students with HIGHEST% and LOWEST%
